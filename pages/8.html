<p class="intro-text-2">Facing a fourth straight year of drought, the State Water Board adopted water-use reduction mandates on May 5 to implement <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/4.1.15_Executive_Order.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gov</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Jerry Brown's April 1 executive order</a> for a 25 percent statewide reduction in urban water use. In the San Diego region, the state's mandate translates to water-saving targets between 12 and 36 percent (compared to 2013 levels) for the San Diego County Water Authority's retail member agencies starting June 1 and lasting through February 2016. These targets will be challenging to meet, but everyone's efforts to save more water add up to make a huge difference.</p>

<p>At its special Board meeting in May, the Water Authority's Board of Directors adopted a set of measures to help local water agencies meet the state mandated water-use reduction targets. These included restricting irrigation of landscapes with potable water to no more than two days a week across the region, and boosting its conservation and outreach efforts.</p>
<p>Local water agencies are responsible for determining the specific measures necessary to meet state mandates and avoid financial penalties by the State Water Resources Control Board.</p>
