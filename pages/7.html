<p>Water use is something of importance.  My family uses water conservatively.  We don't maintain a green lawn  but do have a rose garden.  I use gray water to keep the flowers bloooming.  I capture water when washing hands and dishes for outdoors use.  I wash clothes only with a full load and use a solar drying clothes line.  In the bathroom, I invested in a low-flow toilet.  We also use the policy of two uses to a flush.  Finally, when it does rain, all the indoor plant move outdoors for a natural cleaning and watering.</p>

<p>"Ode to My Houseplants"

Sprinkle, sprinkle from outside, 
Helped me water my plants inside.
But with no rain in the forecast,
I had to find another way, alas!
Now trickle, trickle on top of the dirt,
I now use ice cubes and they don't hurt.
As I'm saving water every day,
While just watering my houseplants in another way!

Years ago I took my houseplants outside, placed them on the lawn, and drowned them with the hose. This took too long and used excess water. Then, I decided to try a different approach. I placed them into my kitchen sink and watered them with the faucet sprayer. This also was time consuming, and I watched dirt overflow from the pots and disappear down the drain. Then, one day before heading out the door to work and needing to water my plants before I left, I placed ice cubes on the soil of each plant. I had found my houseplant watering solution, and as long as there is a drip pan under each plant, it is not messy. This is a slow drip system that works to this day! Saving water every day, every way!</p>

<p>Using poster board, we made a GIANT BLUE WATER DROP and posted it on our wall. We involved our family and friends in brainstorming ideas to save water. Everyone was invited to write water-saving ideas on the water drop. It was never too soon to start implementing suggestions! Ideas we put into action right away included: use a broom vs. a hose to clean (patio, walkways); match water level on washer to the size of your load; take five-minute showers; reuse towels if you can do so; use proper size of pans when you cook; don't run the water while rinsing off dishes in the sink; plug tub before turning on the water; keep pitcher of water in the fridge instead of running the tap water (to get it cold); and use leftover water in the kettle to water house plants.  We plan to keep our giant blue water drop on the wall as a reminder to continue to think of water-saving ideas, find ways to implement suggestions, and share our ideas with others so that they can save water, too.

<p>Teaching water conservation can start at a young age and in a fun way if you just use your imagination! I helped organize a carnival-themed birthday party for several children. Instead of filling the whale-shaped kiddie pool with water, we first made it into a ball pit. Secondly, we had the children toss large rings on the "whale's tail" to earn prizes. Afterwards, the kiddie pool was transformed into a sand box complete with buckets and scoops.  Using the pool creatively saved water that would have been used to fill it up, eliminated the need to clean it with additional water, and prevented mosquito infestation from stagnant water, and it was FUN!! Use your imagination and save water!

<p>I am inspired by the inventive ways my fellow San Diegans are saving water!  All living things are united by the need for water and this is how we conserve this precious resource:  toss water from rinsing out the coffee pot or cooking onto outside plants; use buckets to collect rainwater (including drips from gutters after it rains) for watering herbs, plants and fruit trees; also the drip watering system is on a timer.  We shut off water when brushing, shaving, washing face/hands and while soaping up in the shower and have low flow faucet heads in sinks/showers.  We use a bucket to collecting warming-up shower water and honestly, don't flush every time!  The lid on the compost bin gets removed/turned over during rain to collect spare water for compost and also allows the compost to get watered for free!  Instead of taking hot showers to relax, we opt to soak in the hot tub at the gym instead!  Thanks for the  motivation to reflect on how each of us can make a difference, not only by continuing to find creative ways to re-use water but also by  sharing the message!</p>

<p>Making our Vision a Reality. To save water, we knew our large grassy backyard had to G-O! So, it was "out" with the grass and "in" with the vision of our own orchard full of delicious and healthy fruit! We immediately stopped watering the lawn. As the grass transitioned from green to brown, we researched information about various types of trees, developed a layout, visited a nursery, asked a lot of questions, selected our fruit trees, learned about maintenance and pest control, waited excitedly for our order, and finally planted our trees. Our backyard transformation includes orange, cherry, mango, apple, avocado, plum, peach, and nectarine trees (along with a deck and rock area that provide perfect spots to entertain our family and friends).. Our water savings are up--and so are the oranges on our trees right this very minute!

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>I knew our lawn used a lot of water.  "You are creating an artificial marsh," a friend told me.  Still, it was a look I had grown up with.  We had already made changes indoors with low flow shower heads and low flush toilets.  Our kids knew the "Never Let the Water Run" song for brushing their teeth.  I was reluctant to give up my lawn.  But, an insert in our water bill got me thinking.  The San Diego County Water Authority had a turf replacement program allowing us to be reimbursed for many of the costs of swapping the lawn for something more climate friendly.  We started noticing beautiful low water plants in other yards, nurseries, and botanical gardens and got excited about replacing our lawn!

We moved forward and replaced the lawn using the turf replacement program resources.  Now we water once a week or so with drip irrigation and mp rotator sprinklers.  This year we qualified for the low flow water rate!

Instead of mowing and weeding, we sip a cup of coffee on the porch swing and watch the blooms, butterflies and birds.</p>

<p>I started an adventure with California Native Plants that not only saved water, but it is a vast ecological improvement over outdated gardening methods and it creates habitat for our beneficial wildlife.  

Lots of people are converting their thirsty turf areas to drought-tolerant, but we took this to a whole new level - paying attention to what our natural surroundings tell us about what to plant, where to plant it and how to maintain it. The California Native Plant Society (www.cnps.org) was our inspiration.  

They showed us how to drop our water bill, skip the chemicals, eliminate green waste and create a haven for butterflies and butterflies. People walking by love the way our garden looks and we enjoy it so much as we come home each evening after a long day at work. On weekends, we can sit on our patio and observe nature while helping to improve the future of the planet. 

Water savings started the journey, but we've done things in our garden that mean we are healing the planet, not just making a temporary sacrifice in order to conserve. 
Sincerely,
Tara</p>

<p>Our beautiful swimming pool is the focal point of our yard, but I know that water is wasted due to evaporation. How much? I did some research and found that In San Diego the water loss averages between 1 and 1.5 inches per week, which means I am loosing over 25,000 gallons every year!  A swimming pool cover will greatly reduce evaporation, however I don't want to look at a sheet of plastic or struggle with removing it  (our pool is irregularly shaped) every time we use the pool. After a visit to my local pool supply store I  discovered that there are products known as liquid pool covers (also called liquid solar covers) which form an invisible  micro-thin layer on the water surface to reduce evaporation. With some additional research (note: I am an engineer and enjoy this type of stuff!)  I discovered that  similar products are used by some water agencies in reservoirs and that evaporation rates are reduced by 30-50%.  So by adding just 4 oz. of this product to my pool every week, I  will now save an estimated 7,000 to 12,000 gallons of water annually.</p>

<p>Water is our most precious commodity. We do everything in our household to conserve water. We have installed rain collection barrels, it is amazing seeing how much water can be collect in such a short amount of time from our own roof top! Over half of a households water consumption goes to landscaping, which has lead us to install drought tolerant landscaping.  We also have done everything thing we can to cut down on our household use as well. We don't let the water run when washing dishes and brushing our teeth. We try and take showers every other day, and we keep them short. We have installed low flow water fixtures and appliances. I think being a good stewart of our natural resources is good business for all! We have been talking about how to reclaim the grey water from our home to use on our outdoor landscaping. It is such a waste to see water not get fully used before it goes down the drain! Why can't we use it twice? So that way, we'll have some for tomorrow!</p>

<p>It's so easy to take water for granted.  It is everywhere, you turn on your faucet and it flows freely. You expect it to be served to you at a restaurant. We use it every day to wash our dishes clean our clothes water our yards. We take showers and give our kids baths. We use water to grow our fruits and vegetables and cook our food. 
    Water is everything, we cannot live without water! With that being said my family has done our best to conserve this precious commodity! Our grass is no longer a vibrant color green because we only water it twice a week In the very early morning. My children play a game who can use the least amount of water while brushing their teeth. We have changed our showerheads and purchased a new washer machine that uses very little water. We are doing our best but yet it does not seem enough. We need to remind our neighbors Our family our friends not to take water for granted, Or one day we may turn on the faucet and it won't flow freely.</p>

<p>During the fall and winter months and especially with our current drought situation I have been able to get a bit creative in re-using our water. So, the first thing that I do is turn off the automatic sprinkler system now that fall has begun. Of course the plants and trees still need water so what I do is that every morning two of us take showers and I place a large bucket of water in the tub to collect the excess water and then I use that water to water the yard and the indoor plants.</p>

<p>We Southern Californians many times take water for granted. We enjoy a hot shower; convert it into ice for a refreshing beverage; use it as a solvent for cleaning clothes, dishes, and sometimes driveways; and to convert our coastal desert into a green oasis.

We decided to do our part to conserve this precious gift by taking part in the WaterSmart Program. We converted our lawn into a beautiful water-tolerant garden. With the help of a local landscaping company, Down to Earth-Chula Vista, we converted our high-use water lawn into a water-efficient garden.

Result:  Water usage:  April - October
                          2013:   59 units, or44,132 gallons
                          2014:   30 units, or 22,440 gallons

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>My wife and I moved into our home in Vista back in 1994.  We wanted space and land and boy did we get it.  Half acre plus property, ten watering zones and a water bill to boot.  Mowing weekly, 5 barrels of grass out on the street every Monday had to end.
Over the years we have reduced our watering zones from ten to five and finally we eliminated the largest zone.  The pictures represent our effort of converting 3,450 square feet of lawn to a drought tolerant landscape. 
One hundred percent designed and planted by me and my wife.  Water consumption is down fifty percent from when we moved in and we both lost twenty pounds.  After completion, we speak with our neighbors more often, met new ones, created live entertainment (watching the birds and butterflies) and are thoroughly enjoying sitting in our front yard in the evening and watching the show, so much more than we anticipated.
We begin another drought project in the backyard this spring to continue to lower our water use as part of our "saving every day, every way" contribution.</p>

<p>We have done most of the traditional water conservation projects at the Hayden household. We have installed artificial turf in the side and back yards, installed water efficient showerheads, installed a tank less water heater, installed a drip system for our raised garden beds, replaced our clothes washer and dishwasher with water efficient appliances, installed rain barrels (then prayed for rain), replaced our toilets with dual flush, water efficient units, but the most satisfying change was installing a water diverter in both our showers.
This diversion project allowed us to divert every drop of the water wasted during the shower'[s warm-up cycle, directly into rain barrels located on the side patio, eliminating the need of collecting the water in shower buckets and lugging the 20 to 25 pound bucket through the house to the backyard. We estimate we're saving about 2,500 gallons of water each year. The cost was partially subsidized by SoCal Water Smart rebate program and was therefore quite economical.

<p>We replaced our front lawn with drought tolerant cactus and succulents a year ago and we now have much more color and texture and it lasts throughout the year. Neighbors have stopped by and commented on how nice the foliage looks and the local wildlife also seem to approve as we have seen a significant increase in birds and other critters. Oh, and the cost to put in the new plants and mulch was fully covered from the WaterSmart program and we have reduced our landscape watering by more than 60% (and I don't have to mow the lawn anymore). Our only regret is why we didn't do this before.</p>

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>When we bought our house in 2010, we loved the idea of having a huge lawn in the front yard. But once the out dated sprinkler system (which we had to turn on manually) started to fail and the turf died, it was time to replace the turf and sprinkler system. We removed 900 square feet of turf. On the left side of the property, we replaced a strip of turf with permeable rock. The very front of the house, we replaced the turf with mulch and water smart plants but installed under 400 square feet of West Coast turf. We updated the sprinkler system with a new, more efficient system, including drip irrigation and updated sprinkler heads. No more manually turning on the system. We installed an automated timing system. Set it and forget it! 

Additionally we've replaced an out dated toilet handle with a duel flush button, and the kids take baths together instead of separate baths.

We've only just begun. Next projects are installing more water efficient bathroom fixtures, and water smart landscaping the back yard.</p>

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>After 40 years of planting, watering every 2 days with 17 sprinklers, and mowing every week we decided that saving water was more important for our 1097 sq. ft. area. We hired a designer who drew up a plan and specified 80 drought resistant plants in 19 varieties along with some hardscape features like pots, benches, a rock walkway and some flagstone around an existing Magnolia tree. Next applied for a rebate from the Turf Replacement Program which defrayed some costs. Then hired landscaper to search for the plants, rototill and amend soil, install Netafim drip system, six MP Rotator Sprinklers, place hardscape, plant and cover with mulch. These plants do take regular watering until mature but overwatering rots the roots. The first year there is much tender care and some replacements. Job was completed in January 2014.  We now water every four days controlled by a Rain Dial controller. The last three 2 month billing periods our water usage has declined, 25%, 32%, and 38%. However, it will be many years before we recover the cost but at least we are doing our part in water conservation.</p>

<p>It would be fun to show rather than tell the whole story, from the planning stage of picking out the water wise plants and rocks of various sizes, to seeing the sad lawn finally peeled away, to the execution of the plan.  We used Revolution Landscape to design and develop our new outdoor spaces, and are so happy with the result.  Some of the plants, like the artichokes, are edible; others bloom profusely.  The yard is more usable and attractive, and it varies more with the seasons.  In the front we have ornamental rocks and plants and an inviting new seating area (see photo.)  In the back we have new enclosed planters which have given us a bountiful supply of herbs and greens.  A drab fence is now laced with yummy passion fruit.  The rain barrel the crew installed has been such a gift during this drought, because even the sparse rains from last winter, along with our lovely summer showers, have kept us supplied.  Our new space is also fun and easy to maintain.  I'm so glad we "Revolutionized" our yard!</p>

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>We had a  lawn like so many others, a neat but dull underused area that required regular maintenance and the expense of heavy watering. Motivated to reduce water usage 60%, we replaced our water thirsty lawns with a variety of drought-tolerant native plants, winding DG pathways and a smart controller irrigation system. In our new garden hummingbirds collect nectar from monkey flowers and bathe in the outdoor fountain. Bunnies hide in the shrubs and butterflies gather on bright lantana. Lizards do "pushups" on the warm stone and doves build nests in the wild grapevines. This garden beckons you to stop and relax after a busy day, to enjoy a meal or  glass of wine. Enjoy the shade of the Jacaranda tree on a hot day or the warmth of the patio on a chilly morning. It's the place for a chat, a good read, to curl up in the swing at night and gaze at the stars. It's a romantic wonderland illuminated with torches and candles, a treat for party guests whenever we entertain. So much more than the yard we once had, it is now a place to live and dream!</p>

<p>Being native San Diegans, we have seen the growth and need for more water in our area.  We have done all the things we can, shorter showers, installed low flow shower heads and low flow toilets.  Wash only full loads of clothes and dishes.  Hand wash pots and pans to leave more space in dishwasher for plates. Do not leave the water running for hand washing or teeth brushing.  Last November we removed back grass and replaced it with artificial turf.  This spring we removed all grass from front and side yards and replaced it with succulents and gravel. We needed to water this summer to establish the plants but now they will be okay without any additional water.  We also installed new sprinkles which were recommended by Metropolitan Water.  They are low flowing similar to a light rain. We have our landscape on an automatic timer so we never forget and leave the water running.   We were able to receive rebates for the toilets, sprinklers and grass replacement.  We appreciate the rebates to help offset the cost and they are great incentives.</p>

<p>Well, having our water supply coming from a well is a challenge in itself. You don't have an unlimited supply and you don't know how much you actually have. The ways in which we have saved water over the 23 years living where we do has varied over the years. At first, our well wasn't producing much water, so being new to living on a well we learned that we had to conserve. What we did was wash our dishes in a tub in the sink, then take the tub and pour it on outside plants.....Times got better, more rain came and the water situation improved. Now with a drought upon us, we fill empty milk jugs with water while we are waiting for the water to get warm. It's amazing that between showers and filling the sink to wash dishes, we save on the average about 4 gallons/day of water that would be going down the sink. The water is then used for outside plants or house plants. Our yard is mostly drought tolerant plants or just plain dirt. You don't plant lawns when you live in the country!! That is how we save water!!

<p>Our rain barrel is filled with precious water every week! In case you are wondering, yes, we do live in San Diego. How do we do it? Instead of waiting for rain, we are capturing the weekly flush of our water purifier. The system is set to flush once a week. In the past, these 60-80 gallons of water were lost as run off. Now we have diverted this water from inside the garage, under a walkway, into our rain barrels. The water is used to hand water many low-water plants and a raised vegetable bed. This allows us to completely turn off a few irrigation stations. All of our turf in the front and back yard was removed earlier this year which makes a huge difference as well. All plants are now on drip irrigation. Our family is proud to make every drop count, every day and every way! As many others do, we also collect water in the shower, cooking liquids, water from using the salad spinner, any leftover water and ice cubes from drinking glasses and use it to water house and patio plants. In addition, we installed low-flow faucet aerators and shower heads throughout the house.</p>

<p>I don't know how much I am saving but every little bit helps. This is what I do-
1. When changing the dog and cat's water I water plants with the leftover water.
2. After washing lettuce and other vegetables I save the water and water the plants.
3. When I turn on the water and wait for the water to get warm, I put a bucket under the shower head to catch the cold water. I use it to water the plants.Limit showers to 3 min.by getting wet, turning off the water, soaping down and then rinsing off. Try to shower only two times a week.
4. I use a car wash instead of washing my car. They recycle water. 
5. I wait until I have a full load before washing clothes.
6. I use paper plates and utensils so I don't have dishes to wash. I reuse a plastic cup that I keep in the frig.so it doesn't have to be washed. (I only drink water)
7. I never request water at a restaurant because they usually use very large glasses.
8. I harvest rain water when it rains.</p>

<p>After returning from Afghanistan we bought our first home in beautiful San Diego. A year of living in the house, trying to keep our lawn green and paying $400.00 dollar water bills we knew something had to change.  Luckily, I stumbled across an add for the San Diego Water Wise program and applied.  The great staff was helpful and walked me through the steps to qualify.  Like that, I was excepted and jumped in with both feet.  I will tell you that I was over my head and quickly felt I had bitten off more than I could chew.  After 6 months of working in the yard, renting equipment, shoveling gravel nights and weekends the finished product was finally in site.  I must admit that a lot of the motivation to keep going came from my neighbors as they would come by daily to see what progress I had made. My work also helped to inspired my neighborhood to improve their yards and save a little water at the same time.  For me, I was able to cut my water bill by 50%, save water and I have a great looking yard.</p>

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>"I love my grass" was a frequent refrain at Cardiff Park HOA when residents were queried about the possibility of lawn removal to save on water. Families had emotional attachments to the turf because their children and dogs like to play on the lawn areas. When the HOA realized they were several thousand dollars over budget on water for 2013, it was time to take action.<br/>
<br/>
	Many owners volunteered to give up 50% of their common maintenance area lawns. These owners accepted the HOA's vision of habitat gardens with yarrow and butterfly plants that would attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Some owners opted for adding dry creek streams with cobble and rocks. Others wanted themed gardens with horse, cowboy hat and boot planters. Each owner was pleased to add their personal design elements to complement the drought tolerant plantings.<br/>
<br/>
	Cardiff Park HOA applied for Turf Removal Rebates from the Metropolitan Water Authority for the 7,000 sq ft of turf removed in the first phase of their project-the HOA received a rebate for almost $14,000- a great incentive for turning grass into cash!<br/>
<br/>
	Everyone is happy with their new habitat gardens- especially the butterflies as they glide from plant to plant!

<p>Why keep that unattractive, high-maintenance, thirsty lawn? Thanks to a turf replacement rebate, we moved forward with our plan for putting in all drought-tolerant plants and underground watering lines.  We included flagstones that are lined with hardy Dymondia plants to add green without the need for much water! This also allows water to be absorbed rather than causing run-off during a rain storm. We even installed a device that automatically cuts water use on damp days! We thoroughly enjoy our new patio extension with its fragrant lavender, colorful little flowers and swaying grasses. And we never even think of that old lawn!</p>

<p span="font-size:16px;line-height:24px"></p>
<p>Our last water bill stated our usage decreased 66%. We purchased forty 55 gallon rain barrels @ $5 each, these irrigate our entire water wise landscape. During the past 16 years we have planted nearly 100 trees on nearly  3 acres using rain water for irrigation; these trees increasingly shade the smaller plants, thus requiring less water usage for sustenance  each year.
We have installed low water fixtures, save washing machine gray water, don't use faucets on full blast, and save all sink and shower water. We change clothes for different chores, designating clothes for inside chores, outside chores and non-chores.  This decreased our monthly washing loads by half. The chore clothes are washed at the end of the month, as some days they are only worn for 15-60 minutes.
Engage and challenge people to conserve,  as we are all in this drought together. A February UT article on our water wise lifestyle inspired many friends to change habits. I highly recommend Brad Lancaster and Gary Paul Nabhan's books ( in the county library system) and websites to inspire, challenge and educate you. When every Californian understands and changes their habits, it all adds up.</p>

<p>Our family volunteers as a foster home for a local dog rescue, and we have found that many of the pups enjoy staying cool and splashing in a backyard kiddie pool. However, with water conservation being a growing concern, we stopped filling the pool (much to the dismay of our furry friends). Then our family came up with a solution, thanks to the smart thinking of my 9-year-old daughter, Nova. She commented that a lot of water goes to waste while bringing showers "up to temperature," and she suggested we collect the initial water from a shower into a large bucket, and set it aside to be used elsewhere. We loved the idea, and with five people in our family taking showers, this resourceful practice now generates enough water to fill the dogs' small pool. When the water in the pool begins to grow algae and needs to be replaced, we scoop it back out of the dogs' pool and find an additional and final use for it in watering our backyard fruit trees. The trees remain healthy and fruitful, the dogs remain happy and cool, and we are saving precious California water at the same time!</p>

<p>We save a considerable amount of water and money by using this routine: Before my daily shower, I put a bucket under the tap and turn on just the hot water.  It takes about two gallons to get hot.  I put the bucket aside and have my shower.  I pour the saved two gallons into a watering can and use it on individual plants and trees which saves water and does double duty to save money.  There is the initial cost to me of two gallons, however I save the cost of two more gallons that I would have used from the garden hose and I also save the cost of sending
 the initial two gallons of warm-up water down the sewer.  Counting those last two things, figure monthly savings of 60 gals fresh water and 60 gals of wastewater times 12 months, is 720 gals.  My wife and I both do this, so it saves water and the cost of 1,440 gallons per year.  Think of the savings if thousands of people did this...</p>

<p>1) Given the higher cost of water, we had to make choices concerning where to use our water. Our lawn lost and has become a perfect parking area for our cars. We also are not planting plants which require a lot of water. 2) We reuse the same glass all day rather than taking a fresh one out of the cabinet. 3) We do completely full loads of dishes in the dishwasher. 4) We purchased a low water use washing machine. We also do full loads to reduce water usage. 5) When we replaced our 50 gallon water heater, we went smaller with a 40 gallon water heater. 6) We catch water from the roof when we do have rain in southern California. 7) We have a pool cover to reduce the evaporation of the water in the pool.
All these efforts help to reduce our use of water.

<p>We save water by having 5 gallon buckets in both of our showers for us to run the water into before the water gets warm. When it rains, we have our 55 gallon trash cans at the edge of our roof to catch the rain water runoff. When doing the dishes, we only run the water after we have washed all of our stuff. When brushing our teeth, of course we have the water off while we brush. We then use the water collected in our buckets and trash cans on our plants in our yard. Saving water is really easy if you are willing to put in the effort. I would say I have saved at least $25 bucks a month due to my water saving efforts. I just hope everyone else figures out a way to save water like I have. Thanks

<p>My wife and I are deeply concern about our region's drought and engaging in water conservation efforts. Therefore, we've engaged in the following practices that we recommend everybody use:

We have a five-gallon bucket in our shower that we fill while we wait for hot water. While we shower in five minutes, we keep filling the bucket. Once bucket is full, we dispose in toilet flushing yellow water.
	When e don't dispose of the aforementioned bucket into the toilet, we water our small herb garden and our lemon tree. We use a biodegradable soap that doesn't harm the plants.
	For our garden, 90% of our plants are succulents and drought resistant plants that only need water once in a while.

<p>Growing up, my family lived in apartment complexes where water came "included" with rent, so waste was the norm. It was during a college chemistry class that I learned to be conscious about water-use. After leaving a faucet on while cleaning lab equipment, a German exchange student handed me a nice lecture about water waste. She was not just speaking to me but to all she had observed wasting water during her stay. Long story short, now at my house everybody is conscious about water-use or they get "the lecture". Even my 9 yr. old son turns the shower off while soaping-up.
At home, we've changed our traditional sprinklers to a drip irrigation system. We use gray water to irrigate non fruiting plants, and have replaced a good size of our landscape with drought tolerant plants. We have used incentives to install a smart irrigation controller, use rain barrel water to irrigate and car wash...The list is long, but we are saving every drop we can and along the way and have saved money. We have reduced our water use between 20-40%. Hope this inspires others to continue saving our most valuable resource.

<p>My family has helped save water by limiting our shower times, turning off water while washing dishes only using water to rinse. Also we have changed our outdoor landscaping to plants that need very little water to ensure we don't have to water out yard daily. We also have replaced our shower head to one that shuts the water off when not in use.</p>

<p>Our home has been doing our best to conserve water. We don't leave the water running when brushing our teeth, we only run the dishwasher when it is full, we take short showers, we take our cars to car washes that reuse water, and our yard is already filled with drought tolerant landscaping.</p>

<p>Buckets have become our best friends. While taking shorter showers, making sure the dishwasher is full to the brim before running, rinsing dishes from a pan of water instead of under a running tap, we keep a bucket in the shower, and one in the kitchen as it takes some time to get the water "hot" from the water heater in the garage.  All that water goes to the outside potted plants and  our garden.. Every little bit helps, right?</p>

<p>1. We keep a large bowl in each of our bathroom basins collecting water when washing  hands/teeth--about a gallon each time. We use it to flush toilets.  We collect it in small buckets kept in the bathtub or next to the toilet. We use water-saving toilets.  
2. We've installed water-saving shower heads in all bathrooms.  We collect all water, when turning on to warm it up,  in a bucket we keep underfoot while showering .  We shut off the faucet when lathering up. The water collected is kept for flushing toilets as needed.
3. We keep a large plastic tub in one of the two kitchen sink basins.  We use it to collect the water used when rinsing produce, hands, etc.  The water collected, which can be up 10-15 gallons, is then used for rinsing dishes before putting into dishwasher, for flushing garbage disposer,  and for watering all plants. 
4.  Whenever possible we eat out of paper/plastic plates and use plastic utensils.  All in all, we probably save an average of 30-35 gals./day (3 adults).
5. Use disinfecting wipes to clean hard surfaces, not soap and water.</p>

<p>When we purchased our home in North Park, the backyard had over 1000 sq ft of grass &amp; high water plants. We selected this home, which is half the size of our previous home, to reduce our footprint. We provide rescue to dogs &amp; we needed the large yard space. Since purchasing our home, we have installed artificial grass, replaced all of our plants with drought tolerant landscaping &amp; installed a rainwater catchment system. We grow our own vegetables, but installed a drip line to be water efficient. Our water use has declined dramatically, while still giving us a great space for our rescued dogs to play! We also put in a Buddha garden where there was grass and created spaces in our yard that are lovely, but do not require water usage. Most importantly, we have reduced our home size (and belongings) in half, eliminated grass/plant watering and implemented systems that allow us to grow food, be water wise and still provide a refuge for dogs in need. We have learned that it is not that difficult to reduce the environmental footprint of an entire family, rescued dogs included!</p>

<p>Current data shows the average water consumption is 100 gallons/day per person.
We are committed to using less. Our water consumption is approximately 80 gallons/day for two people and pets and landscape.
We have a high efficiency washer, tankless water heater, solar energy, to conserve energy and decrease greenhouse gasses.
We recycle water by using two aquaponics systems, 1 providing an addition to our landscape complete with pond and waterfall. Water is used to water plants, plants use nitrates from fish water, filter and return clean water to pond using a bell siphon system requiring no energy to operate.
We also recycle bath water to a 50 gallon food grade plastic barrel for use on non-edible plant material.
We also use drip irrigation and MP Rotators for turf irrigation, utilizing a weathermatic irrigation controller with weather station to monitor correct amounts of water and turn off during rainy days.</p>

<p>Because our home was built on a concrete slab, it takes a while for hot water (about a gallon of water) to get to the shower.  We have placed a plastic bucket in the shower and run the hot water into the bucket until it gets warm, then we take our shower.  We use this gallon of water to water our plants.  This saves on water waste and conserves on plant watering.</p>

<p>We have taken many steps to save water, they include; 
Putting 2 buckets in the shower to catch the water used while waiting for the water to heat up, and we keep the buckets in the shower while taking a shower, we use this water to water the yard.  We are also taking shorter showers.   
When we had to replace the washing machine we looked for one that uses a minimum amount of water, and we have a bucket in the wash tub to catch the washing machine water and use it to water outside.
We have a dish pan in the sink and use this water to water the outside plants.
We take our car to the car wash.
We are replacing plants with drought tolerant plants.  
We have low flush toilets.  
If I have water left from cooking, I wait until it cools and water the outside plants with it.  
If I have ice left over in a drink I put it on my plants, or in the yard. 
I feel confident we are doing all we can to minimize our water usage, and save every drop we can.</p>

<p>I have saved about 10 units of water every bill due to removing my lawn and rock-scaping my yard with some nice Desert Pink Rock. I don't really miss my lawn; as my yard is now maintenance free! The palm trees I have that complement my "rock yard" and my beautiful 30 ft. tall plumeria trees take only a watering once a week, and they are now on a "drip" system. I still have a beautiful yard, maintenance free, and saving many gallons of water each bill.

<p>I have replaced sprinklers with drip hoses. I don't use a hose except for the bird bath. I have done this even in the raised beds. This has allowed me to raise enough vegetables to feed myself and my neighbor during the summer while reducing my used water 1/3 ---- My yard is done in xerophilic natives and I've added milkweed so the butterflies and bees are happy. A grey water system on the washing machine. No lawn, but some clover for the dog - herbs, flowers and veggies. Plus I have the two rain barrels your program helped buy, waiting for winter rains. Thanks for the help!

<p>We have a Boy Scout in our family so we tasked him with finding ways to conserve water! He immediately suggested that when we refill clean water in our dogs bowl, the old water could be put on a plant instead of down the drain... This got him thinking of how we use water to push kitchen waste down the disposal, and we instead set up a compost bin! That also saves water as we use the resulting mulch to prevent evaporation on our plants! We then walked through the inside and outside of the house looking for faucet leaks to fix, but I think the tip,from my son that I liked the most was placing a bucket in each shower to capture water while waiting for the temperature to get warm, then using the bucket to fill the birdbath, wash the car or water shrubs! Involving the kids helps them to feel involved and motivated to continue to implement the ideas THEY suggested!</p>

<p>We have cut back our watering of the yard from twice a week to one every ten days. So instead of the 8 times a month we are down to 3 times a month. Doing the math that is better than a 50% drop in our water usage. We have also installed a fence to split our yard and will be replacing the previous grass area with rock. Our son was a big helper in the project and fully understands the need to save water through the project.</p>

<p>Saving water can be as easy as you want it to be. We swapped out our regular shower faucet for a water saving shower head. You can add a gallon of water in a milk jug to the back of your toilet so your tank doesn't completely empty wasting a bunch of water. Washing dishes, fill up one side of the sink with soapy water and one side with clean. So you aren't running the water all the time. Limit your shower times, set a timer or don't fill up the tub so full. Put your little ones in the same tub. Little changes add up to a lot of water. Each time we need new appliances we upgrade to the most energy, water saving model.</p>

How to put bricks in the toilet to save water. How wash clothes properly and save water. How to not waste water on watering our lawn and we got our neighbors to do the same. Showed the kids how to catch rain water and use that to water our garden. How to use a drip system to save water in the garden. That is just some of the things we have done to save water.</p>

<p>To do my part in water conservation I have begun to make many lifestyle changes that have reduced the amount of water I consume. This involves turning off the water when I brush my teeth and wash my face, washing my dishes in the sink without the water running, removing two showers from my daily schedule each week, taking shorter showers, and only using full loads when washing clothes. The biggest water-saving decision I made this year was removing the live turf from my front yard and replacing it with artificial turf. Lastly and most importantly, I am teaching my young son the importance of conserving water so that when he is older he will understand the importance of this precious resource and take steps to reduce his water use.</p>
